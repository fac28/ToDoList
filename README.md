## User Story <a name="user-story"></a>

As a busy person I want to:

- add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
- check tasks off my list to see what I've done
- delete tasks from the list if I don't need to do them anymore
- use all the features of the app without relying on a mouse.

## Acceptance Criteria <a name="criteria"></a>

A working to-do list
Tests for (at least) each user story
A responsive, mobile-first design
Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
